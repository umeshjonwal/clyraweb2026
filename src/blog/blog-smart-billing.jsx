      <h1>Boosting Retail Revenue with Smart Billing</h1>
      <p>Modern billing systems do more than receipts. They capture product performance, customer cohorts, and inventory in real time — turning the counter into a growth engine.</p>
      <h2>What to look for</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Barcode + QR support</li>
        <li>Discount rules and bundles</li>
        <li>GST/VAT ready exports</li>
        <li>Dashboards your team actually uses</li>
      </ul>
      <p>With automation and simple UX, billing becomes a lever for loyalty and margin — not a bottleneck.</p>
